		*SC_INVISIBILITY, SC_DEADLYINFECT, SC_ENERVATION, SC_GROOMY, SC_IGNORANCE, SC_LAZINESS, SC_UNLUCKY, SC_WEAKNESS, SC_MANHOLE, SC_SIMENSIONDOOR, SC_REPRODUCE
			-Added full support for these skills.

	r23 [15peaces]
		*Merged missing changes from 3ceam rev. 82 - 93

11/16/2014
	r22 [15peaces]
		*Merged missing changes from 3ceam rev. 70 - 81
		*Removed Electric Shocker from Researchtrap list to increase range. Should not affect boss monster.
		*Fixed a typo in GN_CARTCANNON.
		*Fixed some Compiler Warnings. More will be fixed soon...
			-fixed an compiler warning in clif_skill_setunit
			-this function was updated for the new ragexe, but there was a typo until today.
			-sorry for this.
		*Reduced the timer interval from 50ms to 20ms (official value)
			-For a long time it is well known that the Aegis interval is 20ms, but devs have been hesitant to set it to that out of performance reasons; these days however, machines are better and there aren't really many 2000+ player servers anymore, so a 20ms interval is actually quite viable now.
			-Setting the interval to 20ms makes the server perfectly in sync with the client that expects the server to have a delay of no longer than 20ms.
			-All skills that are "chain-able" on official servers will now also be 100% chain-able here (previously it just worked to 40%), assuming there is no lag
			-Skills with cast time will no longer go off 30ms later than officially
			-Several others improvements in regards of client-server sync (timers are used almost everywhere)
			-This might increase the CPU usage by up to ~50%, if you have trouble running your server with this, you can increase it again in timer.c (TIMER_MIN_INTERVAL)
			-Bosses are now able to ignore skill-induced walk delay. They can for example walk after casting Sonic Blow.
		*RA_AIMEDBOLT; RA_WUGSTRIKE; RA_WUGBITE; RA_WUGRIDER; SC_SHADOWFORM
			-Added full support for these skills. However some formulas may be outdated. ^^

		*MAX_SKILL increased to 3036.

			-Tables updated are jobs, emotions, map types, use skill fail messages, bl types, ammo types, equip positions, equip indexs, INF2, required state, skills, units, status icons, options
		*Changed LOOK_FLOOR to LOOK_RESET_COSTUME since RESET_COSTUME is the official name for it.
		*All 3rd jobs, baby 3rd jobs, Expanded Super Novice, Kagerou/Oboro, and other jobs are now fully coded in the source code. Its possible to change into them, however all you can do with them is regular attacks and move around. Leveling, skills, equips, and other things currently don't work for them.
