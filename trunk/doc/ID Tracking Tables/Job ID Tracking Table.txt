To whoever holds a copy of this table: Please only use this table for reference. Do not edit this table
and post it as your own. I put a lot of my time into makeing this and other ID tracking tables.

Before reading, be sure to remember this at all times...

"The primary advantage of transcending first is that one is able to learn the transcended skills before turning to
the 3rd class, whereas changing immediately from base 2nd class would never be able to obtain them."
Information from Doddler's RO Future Website.

This means theirs 2 different skill trees for each job server side, one with the trans skills and one without the
trans skills. I also have the feeling theirs another difference besides skills.

*Confirmed*
I was right about trans 2nd to 3rd ID's getting something more then trans skills. This was translated by Doddler...

- Characters that change to Rune Knight/Arch Bishop from trans second class will now have more HP/SP than those who
chanced from normal second class.

This means that all trans 2nd classes that change to 3rd class will get the +25% Max HP and SP bonus. Any base
2nd class that changes to 3rd class will not get the +25% Max HP and SP bonus.

Finally, all 3rd class jobs are able to equip trans equips no matter if their a base or trans version.

The format is as follow...

Extra Info 1: (Base 2nd to 3rd) These are the ID's for if the player changes from a base 2nd job to a 3rd job.
A example is a Knight changeing to a Rune Knight. These ID's will not have access to trans skills since the job
skill tree chains will skip the trans jobs trees.

Extra Info 2: (Trans 2nd to 3rd) These are the ID's for if the player changes from a trans 2nd job to a 3rd job.
A example is a Lord Knight changeing to a Rune Knight. These ID's will have full access to trans skills since
the job skill tree chains will link through the trans job trees. These ID's also get a +25% Max HP and SP bonus.

This show's that their will be 2 different skill tree's for each job, one without trans skills and one with trans skills.
I think what they did was smart.

Note: For some reason, ID 4053 was skiped and wasnt used and the 3rd class ID's start at 4054. Why is this???

Note 2: The Job Skill Tag Mark is the 2 letter mark at the beginning of the skill tags. They usually mark which job
orginally uses this skill. These letters helps us figure out which skills belong to which jobs. However, some past
skills can be accessed by more then 1 job.
