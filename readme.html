                    eAthena is a collaborative software development project revolving around the creation of a robust massively multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) server package. Written in C, the program is very versatile and provides NPCs, warps and modifications. The project was jointly managed by a group of volunteers located around the world as well as a tremendous community providing QA and support. eAthena was a continuation of the original jAthena project. However, eAthena isn't updated anymore. It got replaced by certain continutations like hercules and rAthena.</li>

					15-3athena is another pre-renewal 3rd class eAthena modification. It comes basically as a remake and extension of 3ceam. So most of contents and their copyrights go to 3ceam-devs. However, it'll take time to get a first stable version, but let's try our best!</li>
