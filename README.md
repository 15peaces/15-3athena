15-3athena
==========

15-3athena is another pre-renewal 3rd class eAthena modification. It comes basically as a remake and extension of 3ceam. So most of contents and their copyrights go to 3ceam-devs. 

However, it'll take time to get a first stable version, but let's try our best!

Note: This project emu uses pre-renewal (classic) game mechanics.
