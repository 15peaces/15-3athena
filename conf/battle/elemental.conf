// Note 1: Value is a config switch (on/off, yes/no or 1/0)
// Note 2: Value is in percents (100 means 100%)
// Note 3: Value is a bit field. If no description is given,

// Things needing testing on official.
// Can't be targetted by support skills (except for their master)
// Mobs will always go after them instead of players until attacked

// Defines various elemental AI related settings. (Note 3)
// 0x001: When enabled elementals will update their target cell every few iterations
//        (normally they never update their target cell until they reach it while
//        chasing)
// 0x002: Makes elemental use their "rude attack" skill (usually warping away) if they
//        are attacked and they can't attack back regardless of how they were
//        attacked (eg: GrimTooth), otherwise, their rude attack" is only activated
//        if they can't melee reach the target (eg: sniping)
// 0x004: If not set, elementals that can change target only do so when melee attacked
//        (distance player/elemental < 3), otherwise elementals may change target and chase 
//        ranged attackers. This flag also overrides the 'provoke' target.
// 0x008: If set, when a elemental loses track of their target, they stop walking
//        inmediately. Otherwise, they continue to their last target tile. When
//        set elementals also scatter as soon as they lose their target. Use this mode
//        to make it much harder to elemental-train by hiding and collecting them on a
//        single spot (ie: GrimTooth training)
// 0x010: If set, elemental skills defined for friends will also trigger on themselves.
// 0x020: When set, the monster ai is executed for all monsters in maps that 
//        have players on them, instead of only for elementals who are in the vecinity
//        of players.
// 0x040: When set, when the elemental's target changes map, the elemental will walk towards
//        any npc-warps in it's sight of view (use with elemental_warp below)
// 0x100: When set, a elemental will pick a random skill from it's list and start from
//        that instead of checking skills in orders (when unset, if a elemental has too
//        many skills, the ones near the end will rarely get selected)
// 0x200: When set, a elemental's skill re-use delay will not be applied to all entries of
//        the same skill, instead, only to that particular entry (eg: elemental has heal
//        on six lines in the elemental_skill_db, only the entry that is actually used
//        will receive the delay). This will make monsters harder, especially MvPs.
// 0x400: Set this to make elementals have a range of 9 for all skills. Otherwise, they 
//        will obey the normal skill range rules.
// Example: 0x140 -> Chase players through warps + use skills in random order.
elemental_ai: 0

// Elementals by default don't attack at all while in Wait/Passive/Defensive modes.
// If enabled, they will be allowed to attack by attacking the master's target,
// attack any enemy that attacks its master, and attack anything that attacks it.
// This will not make elementals aggressive on these modes.
elem_support: no

// Elementals set to offensive mode have a chance of using their offensive skills when attacking.
// By default the chance is 5%, cast time is 1000ms, and aftercast is 10000ms.
// Note: These settings only apply to autocast triggered skills. The aftercast only stops further
// autocasting until it ends and doesn't stop manual triggering through Elemental Action.
elem_offensive_skill_chance: 5
elem_offensive_skill_casttime: 1000
elem_offensive_skill_aftercast: 10000

// Does autoloot work, when a monster is killed by elemental only?
// Config not yet supported.
