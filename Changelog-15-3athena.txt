				--The following skills deal "Self" damage: Burning, Pyrexia, Leech's End, Toxin
				--"No source" will neither be logged nor contribute to the total damage, your exp share doesn't increase from the damage, but it also won't cause the monster to give less EXP, it won't break freeze or similar status changes, it won't make you 
				--stand up, it won't make you stop moving, it won't prevent you from logging out
				--"Self" damage will now be logged and contribute to the total damage, it makes monster give the exp tap bonus, but also makes monsters give less exp the more "self damage" they've taken, it will break freeze and similar status changes, it 
				--will make you stand up properly now, it will make you flinch and stop moving, it will prevent you from logging out, but angry type monsters will not lose their aggressive bit from it and it will not cause monsters to use their rude-attack skill

			-Updated Brandish Spear(5x5), Focused Arrow Strike(13x3), First Wind(5-9x3), NPC Breath attacks(14x7), Flame Launcher(5x3) and Cannon Spear(11x3) to use this algorithm and corrected range, splash and maxcount values for all these skills
			-Fixed Brandish Spear's AoE being completely wrong and having holes in its AoE when attacking diagonally; also fixed the knock back being 3 instead of 2 and not working at all for the longest reach; Brandish Spear's AoE width and length can 
			-now be defined in skill_db.txt
			-Focused Arrow Strike, First Wind and NPC breath attacks will at least hit one target, if no enemy is on the AoE, the target will be hit instead; Brandish Spear, Flame Launcher and Cannon Spear can completely miss
		*The following monster level 10 skills now have their official effect
			-Two-Hand Quicken: Increases ASPD by 70%. Duration 300s.
			-Lord of Vermilion: Deploys units in a 15x15 area that splash 1 cell into LP each. 520% damage per wave.

			-aMotion and min_skill_delay_limit are no longer applied at cast end nor by auto spells
			-Aftercast delay can only increase the delay and never decrease it
			-When there is no aftercast delay, the client will no longer show a non-existent 10 second delay
			-Removed "double cast" code of Jupitel and Waterball, it's no longer needed as it fits into the official delay system
			-Added a constant SECURITY_CASTTIME, which is added at cast begin and subtracted at cast end to prevent hackers to send in skill packets before the timer triggers cast end
			-Set skill_amotion_leniency to 0 by default as it applies delay at cast end and would consequently block the official system from working; you can set it back to 90 or even 140 for increased security
		*Thunder Storm, Exploding Dragon, Lightning Jolt and Snowflake Draft can now damage more than just once every 500ms
		*Official status change base durations for Freeze and Blind
			-Snowflake Draft now has a skill-specific duration of 5s*level

		*Guild Bound items are now removed when someone is offline and expelled.
		*Some misc cleaning & fixing.
		*Changed Guild/Party Bound Item Retrieval Methods:
			-Now resend the list to map-server from char/inter-server to avoid "weird" item allocation on guild storage. Example, previously you will meet stacked item like GUID does, but it shouldn't!
			-Also will check the maximum amount that can be store in guild store. If guild storage is full (the slots or item stack limit is reach) the rest value/item will be dropped.
			-Withdrawn members will now lose guild bound items - they will be stored in guild storage.
			-The withdrawn guild member will now prevented to login when retriving items are in progress.
			-Delete guild bound items from guild master when guild is disbanded! Previously, the bound type just changed to NONE. Also for party bound item.
			-If withdrawn guild/party member is trading bound item when be withdrawn, the trade will be canceled!

			-When a monster gets attacked, it will now switch to the attacker even if the attacker is farther away than its current target and the current target is auto-attacking it
			-Angry mode monsters will now always switch target to the first person that attacked them

			-Also split ZC_SKILL_ENTRY2 part (new function: clif_graffiti) since it is only used for Graffiti.
			-Updated & fixed trap visibility to official behavior.
				--Already placed traps are invisible by enemies entering the screen by default.
			-Thanks to @rathena
		*Documented already used 'NeedLevel' for Homunculus skill tree.
			-Old 'JobLevel' is used as 'NeedLevel'.
		*Fixed an issue that caused the damage output to be halved in some cases with high forged weapons.
		*Fixed Shockwave Trap (HT_SHOCKWAVE) SP reduction, should be % of MaxSP not % of 'current' SP.
		*Added skill flag INF2_HIT_TRAP (0x20000) to remove hardcoded 'skill that can hit traps'.

12/27/2024
	r493 [15peaces]
		*Please don't forget to add the upgrade_15-3athena_svn493.sql file!
			-This fixes a display error with some permanent granted skills...
		*Fixed mapcache compilation.
			-The mapcache now got its own main routine. No need to do all the initialisation for stuff that's not needed there.
		*Updated/optimized/fixed monster AI.
			-Monsters no longer use rudeattacked skills when they receive reflected damage from a player who died.
			-Fixed a behavior which didn't unlock target when it was out of range.
			-Corrected mob_warpslave_sub call with CLR_TELEPORT instead of CLR_RESPAWN.
			-Fixed behavior of looter monsters:
				--They will now by default always target the oldest item in their view range (which makes it seemingly random), rather than always the most south-western item available
				--Added monster_loot_search_type to change this back to old athena style.
				--Their loot range is now "0" meaning they need to be on the same cell as the item to loot it
				--Their AI will no longer get stuck in an endless loop when someone drops an item around the corner
		*Small changes to Izlude Academy warp checks.
			-uses isbegin_quest instead of checkquest now.
		*Fixed Sg_Weapon_Supply_Box.
		*Improved Performance on Mob DB loading.
		*NPC_KEEPING no longer remains on monster after its class is changed.
		*Pathfinding now works exactly as on the client
			-This should solve most of the position lag problems, especially ones that caused monsters to suddenly appear next to you (happened especially often when using icewall)
			-Added a new heap implementation to db.h (POP2, PUSH2, SIFTUP, SIFTDOWN, UPDATE) that simulates the heap that the client uses, there was no other way to reproduce 100% exact behavior
			-I recommend using the old heap implementation for everything else
			-Updated path.c to use the new heap macros and also fixed the order in which the different possible directions are pushed into heap
		*Direction fixes
			-Updated the config setting attack_direction_change from 15 to 0 (official value); that means that a unit's direction will no longer change when it attacks; knock-back effects from e.g. Firewall will depend on the last direction the target 
			-walked into instead.
			-Ensured that the default direction of a monster is always "north", so that immobile monsters will now always be knocked back to the south by e.g. Firewall on default settings, unless a skill like e.g. Backstab changes their direction.
		*Fixed a bug that stopped characters server-sided and caused position lag when closing a skill menu.
		*Walkpath loop fix
			-Move requests one cell west will now be ignored if the target cell is occupied
			-You can now set official_cell_stack_limit to 0 to completely disable it including the limitation above
		*Added OFFICIAL_WALKPATH define.
			-We recently fixed a behavior in *athena that has always made walking easier/smoother, unlike how it actually is meant to be, however since users have been exposed to this behavior for so many years I'm adding this to disable it in order 
				-to save endless posts/bug reports on a intended feature.
			-Also implemented official walk path dealing with obstacle.
		*Fixed a glitch which caused running skills from not stopping when recasted.

12/08/2024
	r492 [15peaces]
		*Some misc cleaning.

			-Targets two cells away will now only take 100%+10%*level damage.
		*Hindsight, Song/Dance Effect fixes
			-Fixed Hindsight often casting level 0 of a skill when the selected auto-skill was of level 2.
			-Fixed song and dance effects staying forever on the screen if the bard / dancer walked out of sight.
		*Gravitational Field will now work as official servers
			-Fixed range of Ganbantein (16->14) and Gravitational Field (9->14)
			-Gravitational Field never misses and can hit hidden targets
			-Similar to Pressure the damage can not be increased or decreased by any means, it even hits GTB users and users protected by Devotion/Sacrifice
			-You can no longer do normal attacks while the skill is active
			-You now can use skills while the skill is active, however, other skills are unable to deal any damage as long as Gravitational Field is active
			-Added the possibility to link different skill unit groups together; if a skill unit group gets deleted, the linked skill unit groups are deleted as well;
				--this was needed because when being hit, all Gravitational Fields of the person being hit need to be removed.
			-Gravitational Field can no longer overlap with itself
		*Pressure and Gravitational Field will now be considered "physical normal attacks" and can consequently trigger Autospells; unlike manually cast spells, Autospells can deal damage while Gravitational Field is active

12/08/2024
	r491 [15peaces]
		*Please don't forget to add the upgrade_15-3athena_svn491.sql file!
		*Fixed a bug where Storm Gust and other miscellaneous skills were not sending the packets to the client; prior to this revision, if you used, SG for example, you wouldn't see the mobs push until you @refresh.		
		*Fixed misc issues with traps:

			-update list of skills that can hit/damage/affect traps.

			-proper knock back behaviors

			-It is a placeholder for unsupported incoming packets (avoids DCs).
			-Also did some cleaning in packet_db.
			-Fixes 2013-12-23+ clients from disconnecting after executing /limitedsale command.
		*Icewall stacking update
			-If you now cast Icewall on an existing ice wall cell, the duration (HP) will no longer be refreshed
			-If casting Icewall doesn't change any cell, there won't be a skill animation/sound anymore (SP will still be consumed)
		*Land Protector now behaves like on official servers
			-Land Protector now protects from units being placed on it, no matter if they have splash range or not
			-Land Protector no longer protects from damage from units not outside Land Protector that splash inside
			-Meteor Storm no longer shows meteors falling if they would land on Land Protector
			-Pneuma can no longer be placed next to Land Protector
			-Also cleaned up the code a bit, so the checks are done where they should be done

			-As units in the south-west are processed first, the knock-back direction will usually be north-east
			-At the edges the knock-back direction will be "to the outside"
			-Land Protector and Ganbantein will influence the knock-back behavior strongly, e.g. if Storm Gust has a hole in the middle, it will have a "suck in" effect
			-Added a config option for those who want the old "random direction" behavior from eAthena

11/08/2024
	r490 [15peaces]
		*Corrected RAG203 [1] item price & also corrected item id in Rebellion Weapons shop.
		*No cell stacking implemented (official version).
			-Split config cell_stack_limit into custom_cell_stack_limit (previous feature) and official_cell_stack_limit (see below)
			-Expanded map_count_oncell by a flag parameter, currently only one flag is supported: only count standing units (needed for official cell stack feature)
			-Added a new function map_closest_freecell that will return the closest free cell using the same order that official servers use
			-Monsters will now actively search for a free cell when starting to walk randomly and when unlocking target
			-When any unit finishes walking (regularly) and is not on a free cell, it will now actively search for a free cell
			-Step actions will be delayed until a suitable cell was found, they will even be executed when the player walked slightly out of attack range
		*Fixed Snap dodge bug.
			-Thanks to @HerculesWS		
		*Improved the Waterball implementation
			-The interval between Waterballs is now 150ms (previously 125ms); due to the timer interval it will alternate between 140ms and 160ms (yes, this is official)
			-While the Waterball effect is active, players and non-boss monsters can no longer walk
			-Added a server-sided canact delay each time a Waterball is shot, which is equal to the one the client gives; this is to prevent hackers from being able to mass-cast Waterball; you can still multi-cast Waterball if your aMotion is shorter
			- than the Waterball interval (i.e. 186 ASPD or higher)
			-The Waterball effect is no longer canceled when the target hides behind an obstacle, but no waterballs will fly and no damage will be applied; walkdelay will remain, but there won't be any canact delay for the caster (meaning he can cast
			- another spell); if the target comes out of its cover during the duration, it will be hit again (this also fixes an exploit against MVPs)
			-Waterball now has a max duration of 10 seconds, even if more water cells are available, the effect will stop; this means that level 10 monster water ball will now only hit up to 67 times
		*Fixed Crimson Fire Formation having a knock-back effect although it shouldn't.
			-It will hit once every 20ms with no knock-back, regardless of whether the target is undead, non-undead or a player

	r489 [15peaces]
		*Some memleak fixes while mapexit.
		*Fixed BS_ADRENALINE & some other skills causing map crashes if casted by monsters.
		*Improved Icewall walk block implementation
			-Moved the configuration setting "icewall_walk_block" to monster.conf
			-Split the configuration into mob_icewall_walk_block and boss_icewall_walk_block so it can be configured for bosses separately
			-Expanded the configuration
				--If the value is set to 1, monsters on an ice wall cell will behave like trapped monsters, that means they won't be able to move at all, they will use idle skills and if they are attacked while nobody is in their attack range, they will use
				-- their rudeattacked skills; this is equal to official behavior of bosses
				--If the value is set to 2-255, it will behave as before but monsters in the AI loop now use both idle and chase skills, but will no longer use their rudeattacked skills even if attacked from range; this is equal to official behavior of 
				-- normal monsters
				--Official values would be "220" for normal monsters (loop until Icewall expiration) and "1" for bosses (behave like trapped monster) on most official servers, but as some official servers have a less exploitable implementation (from 
				-- looping AI only  a limited amount of times up to outright blocking Icewall on all maps with bosses), we decided for less exploitable default values for now which are 75 for normal monsters (loop 15-35 seconds) and 0 for bosses 
				-- (impossible to trap in Icewall)

				--Monk Spirit now reduces the SP cost of all Monk/Champion combo skills to 2 SP
			-Taekwon updates

			-Hunter updates

				--You no longer need to target a brute or insect monster with Double Strafe for the combo to trigger

				--You can still use Beast Strafe after moving as long as it's still within the combo delay

			-Offensive Status Recovery's base duration reduced from 30s to 20s and base chance increased to 100%
			-Increased the maximum number of skill timers from 15 to 40 as they are needed for delayed status changes
		*Scream, Frost Joke and Hammer Fall no longer make a target stop
			-Similar behavior to e.g. Ankle Snare against bosses or in WoE

			-Replaced `bonus2 bHPDrainValue,n,x;` for x = 0 to `bonus bHPGainAttack,n;`. Since x = 1 is same as `bonus bHPDrainValue,n;` and if there are items with bonus with 'x' is different, the value will be sum'd but the type switched.
			-Replaced `bonus2 bSPDrainValue,n,x;` for x = 0 to `bonus bSPGainAttack,n;`. Since x = 1 is same as `bonus bSPDrainValue,n;` and if there are items with bonus with 'x' is different, the value will be sum'd but the type switched.
			-Replaced `bonus3 bSPDrainRate,n,x,y;` for y = 0 to `bonus2 bSPGainAttackRate,n,x;`. Since y = 1 is same as `bonus2 bSPDrainRate,x,n;` and if there are items with bonus with 'x' is different, the value will be sum'd but the type switched.
			-Fixed some item scripts.
			-Updated the documentations.
		*Added mob_is_gvg macro.
		*Fixed Incantation Samurai Card.
			-Unequipping a weapon with Incantation Samurai card will not kill you if you have less than 999 hp and are on a non-pvp map.

			-A devoted player will now get the full 5%+15%*level damage reduction of Defender.
			-Magnificat will no longer increase HP regen.
			-Sitting will now always double the regeneration speed instead of just adding 100% to the regen bonus (i.e. Magnificat + Sitting = quadruple SP regen instead of triple).

09/19/2024
	r476 [15peaces]
		*Fixed up the damage code in regards of damage against plants
			-Rewrote DAMAGE_DIV_FIX so that it rounds damage down when number of hits is negative (damage split on hits)
			-Created a function battle_apply_div_fix that does not only call DAMAGE_DIV_FIX but also makes sure that damage can only become 0 when the custom config setting skill_min_damage is not set for the current skill type
			-skill_min_damage is now 0 by default (official: all types can fail against plants as long as skills have negative number of hits), if set, all skills will deal as much damage as hits
			-Restructured and renamed function now known as "is_infinite_defense" that will work for all 3 damage types and returns if damage is infinite for the current situation, it will now also properly consider all "MD_IGNORE" modes
			-Fixed the order of processing of all 3 skill types in regards of plant damage: first all calculations are done, then plant damage is applied and then DAMAGE_DIV_FIX is applied
			-Sonic Blow and Rapid Shower are now skills with negative number of hits (i.e. they can't hit plants officially)
			-Traps can no longer ignore plant mode (only way to damage plant more is via status changes)
			-Final Strike is now able to hit plants (deals 1 HP damage)
			-When left-hand-wielding, you will now always deal 2 damage to plants per attack, regardless of whether double attack triggers or you don't even have a weapon in the right hand
			-There will no longer be backhand damage to plants (Katar)
		*Land Mine is now a single target skill, the trap still triggers in a 3x3 area, but will only hit the first target that touches it
		*Changed the "Don't return reflect damage" flag from 0x1000 to 0x1000000 as apparently the other flag was already used; updated function description so it's easier to see
		*Improved SC_SIGHTBLASTER structure slightly
		*1st Transcendent Spirit will now work as on official servers
			-The max total stat that is granted by the skill is now BaseLevel-10 with a maximum of 50 instead of always 50
			-It will now work as Marionette Control and calculate the bonus at cast time rather than overwrite all existing bonuses
			-Agi Up and Blessing will now cancel the soul link
		*Fixed various problems that caused position lags on the client
			-Added a define ACTIVEPATHSEARCH in mob.c; if active (default and official), monsters will only grab targets if the walk path to the target is shorter or equal their search range; search range depends on whether the monster is moving or not 
			- (range2 for standing monsters and range3 for walking monsters); this requires a lot of CPU load, if it causes trouble, just comment the define for old behavior
			-Fixed a bug that made monsters display "irregular movement with position lag" continuously when a status change ended that changed their walk speed
			-If the path search fails while a unit is already moving, we will now issue of fixpos packet so that the unit does not only stop moving on the server, but also on the client

09/17/2024
	r475 [15peaces]
		*Autobonus fixes:
			-Autobonus now works with combined positions rather than just a single position
			-Autobonus should now also work with all equipment slots instead of just the first 15
			-This does NOT fix problems with multiple auto-bonuses activating at the same time
			-Fixed "Autocast on magic hit" having its chance halved
		*Monsters will now stop instantly if their target is completely non-existent
			-This is mainly for looters that had their loot taken
			-Hide and most other situations still use the configuration setting monster_chase_refresh
		*Fixed NPC_STONESKIN, NPC_ANTIMAGIC, NPC_MAGICMIRROR
			-Using the skills will now be 100% successful (can't be resisted)
			-Fixed skills not working for players (e.g. Ulfhedinn, Mithril Magic Cape, Platinum Shield)
			-Fixed level 5 and 10 not working at all
			-NPC_STONESKIN and NPC_ANTIMAGIC will no longer change DEF/MDEF, instead they will increase/reduce physical/magical damage percentually, this IS official behavior

09/15/2024
	r474 [15peaces]
		*Added Choco Pet
			-Also enabled evolution from Yoyo to Choco.
		*Added some database entries to prepare for ep 16.1 updates.
			-Also did some cleaning.
			-Added some missing quest-db entries	
		*Knockback, stop effects and Skid Trap reworked, monster chase and direction updates, code optimizations
			-Created a new function unit_blown_immune that will now serve as the central function to determine if an object can be knocked back or stopped
				--Moved the check code from skill_blown to unit_blown_immune
				--Several stopping effects and traps will now use unit_blown_immune to check if the object can be stopped, if not, the object will always move to its target cell before stopping Bosses and monsters immune to knockback will now no longer 
				  be stopped by such traps.
				--Expanded the configuration skill_trap_type and moved its checks into unit_blown_immune, so it's possible to switch the "no stop" behavior off for GVG/BG and monsters individually
			-Monster chase range updates
				--Updated monster_chase_range in monster.conf from 1 to 3; I originally thought official value is 1, but after some in-depth tests it's 3 for the most important situations
				--When a monster cannot issue new "move" commands because it was affected by a status change, but is still moving due to knockback immunity, it will no longer unlock its target and stop
				--Fixed a bug that always caused the chase path monsters calculated to be 1 cell too short causing them to recalculate their path one cell before their goal every single time
			-Fixed the direction calculation once again and optimized it at the same time
				--Now the calculated direction is 100% official
				--Added a new function map_calc_dir_xy that allows to check for a direction between two cells without the need of a block_list
				--map_calc_dir will now just use map_calc_dir_xy to avoid duplicate code
			-Implemented Skid Trap properly
				--The direction of the knockback will now be "away from position of the caster during cast" rather than "away from trap"
				--Skid Trap will now stop the target for 3 seconds; this works even in GVG/BG and on bosses, even though the actual knockback doesn't happen

09/12/2024
	r473 [15peaces]
		*Field Manuals (SC_EXPBOOST and SC_JEXPBOOST) now increase EXP gained from NPC quests (through the getexp script command).
		*Fixed HP_BASILICA.		
			-It won't crash the map-server anymore on changing maps.
		*Added support for UF_NOKNOCKBACK flag in skill_unit_db.
			-Also moved UF_SINGLEANIMATION flag to 0x2000. It is the same flag as rAs UF_RANGEDSINGLEUNIT so it is easier to port skills from there if you want to. You won't need to re-check and switch the skill unit flags for them.
		*Fixed knockback direction for AC_SHOWER, now using target to attacker direction.
		*Various cleanups & fixing.
			-Added and cleaned up comments.
			-Added checks to prevent map server crashes.
			-Some Rebellion fixes.
			-Fixed some Basilica bugs.
			-Fixed potential map server crashes
		*Re-Added support for the min_npc_vending_distance battle config...
		*Fixed an issue where no item-granded drops are dropped anymore.
		*Added some support for the CZ_PARTY_CONFIG.
			-/refuse is not yet working.
		*Added 'spawn_direction' config to client.conf for keeping a character's face direction when teleporting/changing maps/logging in. Default is always North (official).
		*Reverted some parts of the recent Super Novice updates..
			-follow-up 9df96cf
			-this caused some issues with some renewal class limits.			
		*Merged config option knockback_left from rathena
			-Now the default direction is "east" and consequently the knockback direction is "west" when standing
				--This means if the source cell (ground target center or position of caster) is on the same cell as the target, it will be knocked back to the west
				--This also can effect other things like how an object is placed when cast on the cell you are currently standing on
			-If you disable the option it will use the old behavior and use the direction of the unit as default direction (and backwards as knock direction)
			-Special thanks to @rathena
		*Optimized the knockback / instant movement code
			-skill_blown will call clif_blown and ensures the correct client information already, so it's no longer necessary to manually call clif_slide and clif_fixpos after it
			-replaced all calls of clif_slide and then clif_fixpos in row with a single call of clif_blown, makes the code look a lot cleaner
		*Fixed the reflected magic damage to always hit the target and not the paladin when it's not reflected by kaite.
		*Fixed npcwalkto script command.
			-Also some updates to npc's status data handling.
		*SC_BLEEDING is now attached to caster to give exp.
		*Restricted skill_trap_type config to GvG only.
		*Fixed chorus skills were not checking the partner condition.
			-Add kind of handler in skill_check_condition_castbegin for group check and move some from unit_skilluse_id2 (wich not really meant for checks)
		*Fixed map crash when a monster uses GS_FULLBUSTER.
		*Maximize Power no longer stops SP regeneration.
		*MC_VENDING/ALL_BUYING_STORE now immediately fails when it cannot be used on this map/cell.
		*Added support for some NPC_ skills.
		*Revert a recent change, wrong commented line makes misc damage won't be relected.
		*Fixed 'devotion_rdamage' doesn't work for Magic Skills.
			-Note: When this active to reflect magic damage, it still displays dummy damage value on devoted player, and this is custom config at first place. :P			
		*Official Icewall implementation and other fixes
			-Implemented the official icewall characteristic that monsters can only leave an icewall cell to the west or south, the changes include:
				--The "sight" path check no longer checks for the current cell so standing on an icewall allows you to see/attack into any direction
				--The path finding will still ignore the current cell as before but the walk routine will not allow to walk east or north while standing on an icewall cell
				--This leads monsters in the situation where they go through an AI loop not allowing them to escape the icewall (if their target is north or east of them)
				--Monster in this situation will use idle skills and if they get attacked will use their rudeattacked skills if available, similar to traps like Spiderweb
				--Added a configuration icewall_walk_block that allows to configure how long a monster should go through the AI loop before the server allows it any movement, this "safety" system is official and seems to equal about 75 AI loops; if you want 
				--to disable the whole icewall system so that monsters don't get stuck in icewall at all, just set this to 0
			-Implemented the official calculation for "direction"; now you will be considered horizontal/vertical/diagonally aligned with a target cell in the exact same way as on official servers, this is for example used to determine whether an icewall or a 
			-firewall should be horizontal, vertical or diagonal; the only thing that is still unofficial is the default direction (officially always "west"); effectively now there are more situations considered diagonal than before
			-Further cleanups on the idle skill use code for immobile monsters and monsters near a player but without a target (now skill using will always go via mob_unlocktarget)
				--This also fixes that monsters switched to idle mode and start to use idle skills one second too late
		*Warp portal no longer ignores knock back and snap's unit positioning.
		*Fixed (assistant/slave)summons/clone, where they dissappeared when going up to a nobranch mapflag map.
		*'npcskill' now uses AREA_SIZE as maximum distance rather than using skill distance.
		*Updated the unit engine to cache attacker count rather than utilise CPU intensive block iterations.
			-This update removes two unofficial settings, nothing that will go amiss
		*Fixed unit_teleport_timer not removing an unnecessary timer.
		*Fixed teleport typo causing some crashs.
		*Updated monster skill use behavior so monsters use skills the same way and at the same rhythm as official servers, the changes include:
			-Unified the "monster can't move by default" and the "monster trapped" code as it really should behave exactly the same
			-Fixed a bug that caused the "monster skill use" routine to be called 20 times more often than it should in some situations
			-When a monster attacks you and you run away from it, the monster will now check if it has a ranged skill on "attack" state before switching to chase state
			-Monsters will now always do a normal attack before using "attack" state skills
			-Fixed a bug that caused monsters to switch to idle mode and never use their chase skills when they get hit continuously
			-Changed default for skillrange_from_weapon from 30 (all but player) to 0 (none); monsters will now use all skills at the skill range and not at their own attack range, if they get tanked from farther away than skill range, they won't use these skills
		*Updated ranges to work as on official servers, the changes include:
			-Implemented new functions "check_distance_client" and "distance_client", that instead of the server-sided square range system use the circular one that the client uses; these functions should be used for units that send their commands via the client 
			- (players mostly)
			-Applied the new distance algorithm to some player-specific range checks, players will now have a circular attack range that reflects their attack range on the client; this makes it impossible to hack the client for more diagonal range
			-Removed the arbitrary +1 range bonus at range checks; as monsters now react fluently, they won't need it anymore, that means a monster with for example 4 attack range will now only attack targets within a 9x9 area around it, the moment you step out 
			- of this area, the attacks will stop (if the monster can move it will follow you); as for players, the extra cell attack range when on a linear line to the target now is integrated into the distance algorithm, that means a player with attack range 
			- 4 can attack from 5 cells away when directly on line with a monster, but no longer diagonally as range is circular for players now
			-Implemented a new "step action" feature to reflect official chase range behavior; when an attack or skill is used inside the attack range, it will act exactly as now, the skill is used once the signal from the client was received; however, 
			- if an attack or skill is used outside the attack range, the player should move into the chase area which is 1 cell inside the attack range border; the client actually sends us where to use the attack / skill from, but previously we just dropped 
			- that information the moment an attack request came; now instead of stopping the player instantly on an attack request, the player will continue moving to the target cell and then automatically use the command received earlier (it will be remembered);
			- this change was absolutely necessary as the client sends the attack request slightly before attack range is reached, execution on official servers only takes place on every full cell moved; the new system copies this behavior
		*Implemented an improved hit-lock system, the changes include:
			-MVPs are no longer immune to being stopped by a hit unless they used Endure
			-When hitting any unit, it will stop for its "dMotion" interval, exactly at the end of "dMotion" it will continue walking (official behavior); this helps getting more "move" packets to be displayed
			-The unit that was hit will be immune to being stopped for another "dMotion" interval, this allows to slow down any units by hitting them frequently, but makes it almost impossible to completely stop them forever (depends a lot of ASPD and dMotion 
			- value); this does not affect special hit-lock properties (some skills and events should set delay anyway)
			-The unit that was hit will no longer be "pulled" to the next cell; this caused a lot of position lag, it should be much better now Random walking, monster target dropping
		*Implemented official behavior for (random walking of) monsters
			-Updated the interval between walks from 3-6 seconds to 4-5 seconds
			-Added a define MIN_RANDOMWALKTIME that is now used anywhere the interval is applied so it's easier to change
			-Monsters will no longer attempt to walk to the cell they are currently standing on (note: still requires a proper "no cell stacking" implementation)
			-Monsters will only target a cell within a 15x15 area around them
			-Moved the "mob_ai" 0x008 configuration setting to mob_unlocktarget, so it applies to all cases of monsters unlocking targets
			-Fixed a bug that caused monsters to never use their idle skills even if the define MOB_LAZYSKILLPERC was set
			-Monsters now use complex path searching for their random walk, so they can also walk around corners now (OFFICIAL_WALKPATH still applies!)
			-Monsters will no longer stop when using "walk" skills (they are supposed to be used while walking)
			-Increased chase range of monsters by 2
			-Monsters will no longer be able to do normal attacks when hiding
			-If out of any reason a monster on "attack" state can't move and can't do normal attacks, it will now use "attack" state skills
			-The order of monster thought processing is now equal to official servers
		*Added Official Sight Blaster behavior
			-Sight Blaster's AoE is now 3x3
			-Sight Blaster will now prevent traps from triggering as long as they are knocked back
			-Fixed a bug that caused Sight Blaster to not work on traps and ice walls at all
			-Sight Blaster will no longer expire when the attack was reflected
			-Sight Blaster will now expire when hitting an ice wall
			-Sight Blaster will now properly protect you from being attacked from its AoE range
		*Sight, Ruwach and Sight Blaster will now check for a target every 20ms (previously every 250ms)
		*Step action will now be canceled when being knocked back (skills won't be executed anymore when knocked out of range)
		*When knock back magic is reflected it will no longer lead to the caster being knocked back
		*Activated traps can no longer be hit
		*Fixed a problem that left "trap ghosts" forever on the screen when a trap was knocked out of the screen

		*Rewrote the hard monster AI. Monsters will now behave a lot closer to official servers:

			-Monsters will now chase their target during their aDelay, but they still have to wait for aMotion to be able to move again.
			-Monsters will now rethink their chase in a configurable interval (see monster_chase_refresh in monster.conf), official value is once per cell, previously it was once per 3 cells
			-Monsters will now stop when they rethink their chase and their target is gone (player hides or target loot was picked), regardless of the monster_ai setting (note: if you want the old behavior, just increase monster_chase_refresh instead)

			-As tick_def2 is never equal to sc_def2, it will not use it by default anymore.
			-The final chance for the status change will now consider Aegis accuracy (everything between 0.01% and 0.09% should actually be 0.1%, etc.)

			-In the process, fixed the effect of luk on status changes and removed the static 3% resistance that has been proven to not exist (97 vit, 1 luk can get stunned on officials)

		*Updated the success chance of Decrease Agi to the formula that was extracted from Aegis (blevel/5 + int/5 + skill_lv*3 + 50)
		*Implemented the official stun chance of Bash based on an Aegis leak.
			-Basically the base chance (5% per level above 5) will get multiplied by BaseLevel/50.0, so on level 50, it will be 1x, on level 75 it will be 1.5x and on level 99 it will be almost 2x (prior reductions), 
			-e.g. a level 99 knight using bash 10 will have a 49.5% base success chance to stun with it (if he has learned the quest skill).

			-Thanks to @rathena for the base.
			-This was done to optimize and clean-up the cardfix calculations.
		*Major battle calculation engine refactoring! Giant thanks to @rathena for the refactoring work
			-Forced neutral behavior documented and implemented. Weapon element does affect the following skills, but final damage is treated neutral for resistances.
				--End result is endows do boost skill damage as expected given elemental weaknesses or resistances, but forced neutral skills will always miss on Ghost 3/4 mobs as the damage is "forced" back to neutral type after bonuses are applied
				--but before resistances.
			-The following skills are considered "forced neutral"
				--Merchant "Cart Revolution"
				--Creator "Acid Demonstration"
				--Genetic "Cart Cannon" (damage is forced to element of cannon ball, either neutral or holy or ghost)
			-Weapon calculation engine has been rewritten to better emulate official behaviors and "quirks", the following changes have been documented and implemented:
				--Double attack takes priority over criticals when determining which effect activates
				--VITDEF (status or sDEF) is applied on every hit on multi-hit skills, rather than a flat reduction on the final damage total
				--Skills such as Spiral Pierce that differ when used by monsters modified to match official calculation methods
			-Weapon element behavior adjusted to match official behavior, endows override any innate weapon element, including elemental arrows
			-Thief:
				--Double attack gives a hidden +1 HIT per skill level on attacks that activate the double attack effect
				--Envenom gives a flat +15 ATK per skill level when used, it is considered a mastery type damage and has no element
			-Creator
				--Acid Demonstration adjusted to match "forced neutral" behavior on official
					---For example, Acid Demonstration used on a water-type mob with a wind endowed weapon will do bonus damage, but will miss on a Ghost 3/4 monster regardless of endow.
			-Swordsman
				--Magnum break bonus damage gives +20% ATK fire damage on physical attack (so 100% ATK normal + 20% ATK fire)
			-Ninja
				--Final Strike will MISS on plant-type mobs (mobs that only take 1 damage per hit from all sources) 
				--Mirror Image cast over itself will override and reset current Mirror Image count
			-Genetic
				--Cart Cannon "forced element" behavior implemented, damage is "forced" to the element of the cannon ball. 
					---Ex. Cart Cannon fitted with a standard cannon ball and a fire elemental weapon will do bonus damage against earth targets, and a Cart Cannon fitted with a holy cannon ball will do bonus damage against shadow, 
					---but total damage is forced back to element of cannon ball and resistances applied against it. Neutral cannon balls will miss on Ghost 3/4 but holy/ghost/shadow will not.
			-Gunslinger
				--Gunslinger Mine skill formula and behavior matched to official
					---Fixed 500 damage, ignores DEF and is affected by +% ATK weapon cards only
			-Warlock
				--Tetra Vortex behavior modified to match official
					---First 4 spirit spheres are used for calculating element of each hit, but if 5 are present all 5 are consumed
		*Moved pc_dead NPC event calls to the end of the death process
		*Super Novices are no longer counted as dead when saved by their angel

		*Monster HP bars will now use the correct packet.
			-Main support was already there, I forgot to make use of it...
			-Added missing packet_db entry for monster HP bars.
		*When a monster is killed by a assist of yours it now updates quests (homunculus, mercenary, elemental).

		*Some optimizing & fixing:
			-Removed a unused #define.
			-Delayed clearunit now makes use of the ERS which is quite convenient for it speeds up due to the previous amount of mallocs that function would spend.
			-Added extra debug information to the ERS system, now upon allocation you give it a const, human-readable, name.

			-`DBMatcher` functions (used in `DBMap::getall()`) now take `DBData` as a parameter instead of `void*`
			-`DBReleaser` functions now take `DBData` as parameter instead of `void*`
			-Default releasers release data if it is `void*` (`DB_DATA_PTR`) type
			-`DBIterator` functions: `first()`, `last()`, `next()` and `prev()` now return `DBData*` instead of `void*`
			-`DBIterator::remove()` now returns `int` (1 if node was found and removed, 0 otherwise) instead of `void*` and takes an extra `DBData*` parameter for the data of removed entry
			-`DBMap::get()` and `DBMap::ensure()` now return `DBData*` instead of `void*`

			-`DBMap::getall()` now puts data into `DBData**` buffer instead of `void**` buffer
			-Updated macros:

				--added (`i`/`ui`/`str`)`db_iget` and (`i`/`ui`/`str`)`db_uiget` that get `DBData` from `DBMap` and extract `int`/`unsigned int` from it (with `db_data2i`/`db_data2ui`)
				--`db_put`, `idb_put`, `uidb_put` and `strdb_put` data params were wrapped with `db_ptr2data` to match new signature of `DBMap::put()` (`DBData` instead of `void*`)

				--added `NULL` in place of extra parameter for removed data in `db_remove` macros
				--`dbi_first`, `dbi_last`, `dbi_next` and `dbi_prev` were wrapped with `db_data2ptr` to extract data from `DBData*` that is now returned by these `DBIterator` functions
			-Updated `DBMap` documentation.
			-Updated rest of code to reflect `DBMap` changes (mostly required signature changes of `DBCreateData` and `DBApply` functions).

		*Picklog improvements:
			-now it is finally possible to log every item / zeny players gain or lose
			-new log type: `X` for all other items transactions that don't fall into another category (for detailed explanation on all log types read `conf/log_athena.conf`)

		*Reduced the amount of code used for some autocasting status's.
		*EL_WIND_STEP; EL_WIND_CURTAIN; EL_ZEPHYR; EL_GUST; EL_BLAST; EL_WILD_STORM; EL_WIND_SLASH; EL_HURRICANE; EL_HURRICANE_ATK; EL_TYPOON_MIS; EL_TYPOON_MIS_ATK; EL_SOLID_SKIN; EL_STONE_SHIELD; EL_POWER_OF_GAIA; EL_PETROLOGY
		*EL_CURSED_SOIL; EL_UPHEAVAL; EL_STONE_HAMMER; EL_ROCK_CRUSHER; EL_ROCK_CRUSHER_ATK; EL_STONE_RAIN
			-Added support for these skills.

01/25/2023
	r368 [15peaces]
		*Merged missing changes from 3ceam rev. 897 - 898
		*Elemental system recode part 4.
			-This update focuses on adding the structures and handlings for the elementals skills and the status for them. This update also adds support for all of Agni's and Aqua's skills. Now that I have things set on how to handle these skills it should 
			-be a smooth development for the remaining 2 elementals.
		*Added some checks to help stablize the elemental skills.
		*Fixed a issue where LV 1 elementals would not stay in passive mode.
		*SA_AUTOSPELL
			-Aftercast delay is now properly triggered on autocast.
		*NC_RESEARCHFE
			-Recoded the skill.
			-Bonus ATK now only applies to fire and earth element monsters.
			-Damage reduction is corrected to be a fixed reduction.
			-The damage reduction only applies to attacks from fire and earth element monsters.
		*SO_WARMER
			-Recoded the skill.
			-Freeze, Frost Misty, and Crystalize status are now removed by the AoE itself.
			-HP recovery is now handled by the warmer status. This is the official handling.
			-Status is now removed when you walk outside of the AoE.
		*SO_EL_CONTROL
			-Fixed a issue where the skill would fail even if you have a elemental.
		*EL_CIRCLE_OF_FIRE; EL_FIRE_CLOAK; EL_PYROTECHNIC; EL_HEATER; EL_TROPIC; EL_FIRE_BOMB_ATK; EL_FIRE_WAVE_ATK; EL_WATER_SCREEN; EL_WATER_DROP; EL_WATER_BARRIER; EL_AQUAPLAY; EL_COOLER; EL_CHILLY_AIR; EL_ICE_NEEDLE; 
		*EL_WATER_SCREW; EL_WATER_SCREW_ATK; EL_TIDAL_WEAPON
			-Added support for these skills.
		*EL_FIRE_MANTLE
			-Number of hits per cell changed to 1.
			-Due to the damage they deal and with no known official number, its best to keep it safe for now. Especially when you can lure a enemy to walk through multiple cells at a time. 1000% MATK is a lot of damage for 1 hit from a firewall.
			-A regular LV 10 firewall deals 50% MATK per hit for 12 hits per cell.
			-Thats 600% total.
		*EL_FIRE_BOMB; EL_FIRE_WAVE
			-Now has a 50/50 chance of casting 1 of 2 versions of itself.

01/23/2023
	r367 [15peaces]
		*Merged missing changes from 3ceam rev. 895 - 896
		*Please don't forget to add the upgrade_15-3athena_svn367.sql file!
		*Fixed an uninitialized variable error.
			-Follow-up r364 / @596a42a			
		*Added Multilanguage support for msg_conf files.
			-No other langage is enabled by default, change LANG_ENABLE in msg_conf.h
				--Also, there is no other language available yet. Feel free to send me one if you want to translate it... ^^
				--I will maybe add a german translation later...
			-Added 2 new atcommands:
				--@langtype to switch over langages
				--@reloadmsgconf to reload the db
			-The langage choosen is account wide and not reseted by default on relog.
		*Elemental system recode part 3.
			-This part focused on finishing up the rest of the AI related stuff, how the mode switching functions work, and all that happens while a mode is active and what happens during the switching of modes. Database relate stuff is updated to remove 
			-all the useless stuff not needed. Finally, some code was updated to be more compact and efficant now that things are finalized.
			-It is also focused on redoing all the SQL save/load related stuff for elementals and the format that the data for them is saved in. Due to the major rework on the format for their save data a SQL update is required. This update drops 
			-the elemental table and all of the data for them and creates a new one with the new format. This is also important to get rid of any unused elemental data caused by a bug on character deletion.
			-All thats left is to code in all of the skills for the elementals. Should be easy to do since their skills are simple.
		*Replaced the "elem_support" config with "elem_defensive_support" config.
			-It works similar to the old one except it only applies to Defensive mode.
			-Felt allowing a elemental to attack while in Wait or Passive mode was too much.
		*Added "elem_defensive_attack_skill" config.
			-Sets if a elemental can autocast its offensive skills in Defensive mode.
			-Its set to no by default as you can trigger them using Elemental Action.
		*Reaplced "natural_elem_healhp_interval" and "natural_elem_healsp_interval" with
			-"natural_elem_healhp_interval" config. This is necessary due to the changes to their HP/SP regen mechanics.
		*The "eleminfo" command no longer shows the elementals regen rate.
		*Elemental type checks is switched to use the "elemental_get_type" function.
		*Fixed a issue where deleting a character would not delete the data for a attached elemental if one was active at the time of deletion.
		*Updated the elemental_db.
			-Removed quite a number of columns since a lot of it is pointless. Most of a elementals sub-stats are set using formulas different from the norm.
		*Removed the elemental_skill_db.
			-Aegis has the skill selection and management hardcoded. Doing the same here showed to be much easier to do and is more efficant. Plus its easy to add new skills to the lists in the code if needed.
		*Recoded the handling of HP/SP regen to official.
			-HP/SP is no longer regenerated by normal means and is now done through the "Wait" mode status. While this means that status's that normally increases a player's regen rate no longer affects elementals, it also means status's that reduce 
			-or disables HP/SP regen won't affect elementals.
			-For as long as the elemental is in the wait mode it will regen HP/SP. The regen can be doubled when standing in a level 1 insignia of the same element. Regen is only disabled when the elemental is in any of the 3 active modes...
			-Passive / Defensive / Offensive.
		*SP is now drained while in Passive and Defensive modes. If there's not enough SP to continue the state it will switch back to Wait mode.
		*The masters SP will now be drained every 10 seconds for as long as the elemental is alive. If theres not enough SP to continue, the elemental will be lost.

				--Changed auth_fail_login hardcoded logged messages to configured with msg_txt.
		*Elemental system recode part 2.
			-This part focused on adding AI support for the elementals. Elementals will now autocast their offensive skills when attacking and also use them when commanded with Elemental Action. Skills are also handled through 3 seprate skill type functions 
			-and are triggered depending on the elementals set mood.
			-With the main parts of the system now working I feel its safe to enable the Sorcerer's elemental related skills. There's still some bugs as the system is still in development but nothing to worry about.
		*Added AI support for the elementals.
			-Elementals appear to use the same AI as monsters in official and because of this I decided to make a copy of the mob's AI and then do the needed edits to make it usable for elementals. The basic functions and feature are complete which gives 
			-the elementals life. They will follow its master, attack anything the master attacks, attack anything that attacks it, search for and attack stuff when set to aggressive, etc.
		*Added the "elemental_ai" config setting.
			-Allows setting custom AI settings for the elemental's AI.
			-Note: Not all of the settings work since the AI is still under development.

			-Added these configs to the elemental config.

		*Elementals are now only allowed to attack when in offensive mode.
		*Cleaned up some code.

			-With the system recode now stable and mostly working it should be safe to allow use of these skills.
		*Elementals
			-Updated all timer data settings in the skill_renewal_cast_db to prepare for coding in their skills soon. Some may need to be hardcoded later on.
			-All skill animation code is complete (should be) and so is the status support.
		*EL_FIRE_MANTLE; EL_FIRE_ARROW; EL_FIRE_BOMB; EL_FIRE_WAVE

			-Thanks to @rathena
		*Elemental system recode part 1.
			-Removed all status and skill code for elemental skills.
			-There was a lot to track after doing this. Best to commit the changes before doing the elemental system itself as it too is a lot of code to remove.
			-This part focused on recoding the elemental C/H files from the ground up.
			-With the core parts complete, its possible to summon and release elementals.
			-They don't have a working AI yet and will just stand in place and do nothing.
		*All elemental related skills in the Sorcerer's skill tree is set to passive type for now to prevent use of those skills. They will be renabled once the recoding is complete. Gotta error proof things for anyone updating not aware of whats going on.

			-have to be completely redone which will take a lot of work to do.
			-The work load will be spread out between updates to make it easier to keep track of changes in the updates. This first part focuses on adding missing checks in the code for elemental entitys and other similar checks needed to perform

			-This replaces "pc_isSkillFromJob" and is a recode of it.
		*pc_skillup
			-Recoded the checks and message handling for telling the player how many skill points need to be placed into lower tier skills. This is also part of the reason "pc_calc_skilltree_normalize_job" was recoded. Having to update the skill range 
			-check every time new 3rd job skills come out is annoying. Better to let the normalize_job and search_job_skilltree functions work together for this.
		*pc_jobchange
			-Removed JOBL_THIRD from the upper setting switch.

			-JobLV will not affect the success chance when below 50.
			-When above 50, it will add a 0.5% chance bonus for each level above 50.

			-Mechanics now get the full 10% added chance bonus no matter the JobLV.
		*LG_BANDING
			-Fixed a issue where using the skill under certain conditions would crash the server.

		*min_doram_hair_style; max_doram_hair_style; min_doram_hair_color; max_doram_hair_color; min_doram_cloth_color; max_doram_cloth_color
			-Added these configs to the client config file.

			-walk into view range of the one with the spheres.
			-It also fixes a issue where the sphere's may not vanish properly from view when the player dies.
		*Did a small text update in the skill config file.
		*Added the "status_sc2icon" function.
		*Recoded the system that displays status animations for renewal era status's.
			-Status's that were added in during the renewal era don't use OPT3 for resending animation display's to other player's clients around you. Instead they are displayed with a seprate packet called EFST_SET_ENTER.
			-This recode get rid of those 2 huge walls of code that was just temp code and replaces them with much much smaller and more efficent code. This makes it so I don't have to add anything to it when it comes to new skills. The recode also 
			-allows these animations to be shown on monsters and homunculus that come into view of a player.
		*Updated the 3CeAM super stylist to detect the ranges of styles/dyes for Doram character's.

			-banding with  force of vanguard active when requirements are met.
		*Made the code for chorus count checks more efficent.
		*Added the "load_custom_exp_tables" config setting in the exp battle file.

		*LG_BANDING
			-Recoded the skill.
			-The AoE's of each Royal Guard now work seprate from each other.
			-The main 7x7 AoE that moves around with the caster now only affects enemies and gives the status that reduces movement speed. The status is removed if the enemy moves out of the AoE or the AoE vanishes. This AoE doesn't require banding with 
			-other's to make it work. It will work for a player alone.
			-A 2nd AoE is now used with the skill which generates a 7x7 splash AoE around the caster every 5 seconds to check for other Royal Guards near the player that are also in banding status and are in the same party. This is when the stored banding 
			-count is updated, along with the caster's ATK/DEF and also calculates the HP share.
		*LG_HESPERUSLIT
			-Fixed a issue where the element didn't turn to holy when banding requirement's were met.

		*KO_HUUMARANKA (Launch Huuma Shuriken)
			-Damage no longer split between targets.
		*KO_MAKIBISHI (Makibishi)

			-No longer stacks on top of each other.
			-Stun duration is now fixed and can't be reduced.
			-Now places the proper number of makibishi depending on skill level used.
		*KO_MEIKYOUSISUI (Clear Meditation)
			-Recoded the skill.
			-Skill now makes the caster sit when the status starts. If the caster stands up at will or gets forced to stand up, the status will end. This also prevent's the caster from being able to move or use any skills while active due to sitting.
			-Now has a chance of making any attack completely miss the caster while active.
			-Now removes a single debuff by random on use. The following can be removed....
			-Poison / Curse / Silence / Blind / Fear / Burning / Frost / Crystalize.
			-This behavior is official according to zone scans but a bug does exist on official where the skill use animation would stop the caster from sitting, allowing exploiting of skill uses. I coded it to prevent this issue from happening.

			-Recoded the skill.
			-Now has a success chance reduceable by the target's INT.

			-Random status success chance is now 100%, but is reduceable by stats and equips.

		*Recoded the ZC_MILLENNIUMSHIELD packet.

				--
				--Rebellion: No longer has its own mask.
				--Now uses the same mask as the Gunslinger which is 0x01000000

				--base level cap.

		*Fixed a issue where certain item bonuses didn't work with items equipped on the SHADOW_ACC_L equip slot.
			-It appears the equip_index handles AMMO in a special way and needs it at the end of the index table. So I had to also change its placement in the equip_pos to the very end. This issue also happened with equips in the COSTUME_FLOOR, 
			-but vanished when I added the shadow equips support.

		*Some random cleaning.

		*Fixed the gm_all_skill config.

		*Added the INF2_SUB_SKILL.
			-This is used to tell the server if a skill is a sub-skill.
			-A sub-skill is a skill thats used as part of a main skill which is a skill that uses more then 1 skill ID to work. These skills with this setting stops the server from adding these skills to the skill list when using the gm_all_skill feature to

			-for level 1 which is the HP heal/damage thing and 1.5x damage thingy. So it still has a good use.
		*MH_LIGHT_OF_REGENE; MH_OVERED_BOOST; MH_SILENT_BREEZE
			-Added full support for these skills.
			-Note: MH_OVERED_BOOST curretly doesnt give its fixed ASPD effect since their's no way to fix one's ASPD to something at the moment. Will need to make a new function to do this in the future.

			-stupidly loud sound it makes with it. This means the animation will now happen once and only once.
			-Since the client acts retarded and normal eAthena coding techniques cant control the animation, I made a special code to keep the animation in check. Other skills suffering from animation spam issues will follow soon.
		*RK_REFRESH
			-Recoded part of the skill.
			-No longer gives immunity to Quagmire and Decrease AGI.
			-The code that removes status's was entirely redone and uses a lot less coding and is very efficent. Other skills that removes massive numbers of status's will soon be updated to use this coding as well for these reasons.

06/27/2021
	r300 [15peaces]
		*Merged missing changes from 3ceam rev. 749 - 750
		*Some changes/updates related to the episode system.
			-added episode.c/.h files.
			-added a new function episode_sv_readdb. 
				--This will call sv_readdb but will search for a episode database before. If there is one, this file will be loaded.
				--For now only castle_db and create_arrow_db will be read using this function. 
			-added create_arrow_db_ep50 database, also added support for episode specific create arrow dbs.
		*Fixed a issue where NPC's would not stay hidden when hidden.
			-They would reappear on client refresh or re-entering the view radius.
				--The server will no longer send any info about the existence of these hidden NPC's since its pointless to do so. Its hidden and the client doesn't need to know this. Its also one less packet to send.
		*GC_DARKCROW
			-Fixed a issue where the animation would vanish on refresh.
		*RA_UNLIMIT
			-Fixed a issue where the animation would vanish on refresh.
			-Now no longer usable in PvP areas and on turbo track map.
				--Im guessing this applies to GvG since its PvP too.
				--This is according to jRO's info. Plus its damage is very powerful and unbalanced for PvP use.
		*LG_KINGS_GRACE
			-Added some pre-support for the skill.
			-Currently only displays its AoE animation and does nothing else.
		*ALL_FULL_THROTTLE
			-Updated the mechanics of the skill.
			-Full Throttle status now fully restores HP and increases movement speed.
			-Full Throttle status now drains a percent of SP each second.
			-Rebound status now activates when Full Throttle status ends.
			-Rebound status reduces movement speed, disables natural HP/SP regeneration, and displays the sweat emotion.
		*Added the dragon, falcon, and cart commands.
			-The dragon command allows you to mount on a dragon and choose what color dragon you want. Basicly gives a different sprite.
			-The falcon and cart commands does what it says. Gives a falcon or a cart. All commands require a GM level of 20 by default.
		*Changed the name of the warg_can_falcon config to falcon_and_wug.
			-It was confusing and needed to be changed.
		*Added the marionette_renewal_jobs config.
			-This allows the skill Marionette to have a higher stat increase cap on renewal type jobs. The stat increase cap is whatever max_parameter_renewal_job is set to.
		*Added the BaseThird script const.
			-This allow checking for a certain 3rd job class in general.
			-For example, instead of doing a "Class" check for every existing Rune Knight job seprate, you can use BaseThird to check for all at once and it'll pass as long as the player is a Rune Knight.
			-Note: This should not be used for Kagerou/Oboro or Rebellion since their 2nd jobs. Use BaseJob for that.
			-Example:
				--Before - Check for all 3 are seprate.
					if (Class == Job_Rune_Knight || Class == Job_Rune_Knight_T || Class == Job_Baby_Rune_Knight)
				--After - Checks for all 3 in 1. Regular, Trans, and Baby versions.
					if (BaseThird == Job_Rune_Knight)
			-Check the npc/custom/breeder.txt file to see a example of it used in scripts.
			-I replaced it by the 3ceam version, it now supports all 3rd job mounts.
		*Updated the skill files with new place holders.
		*Added the 3ceam breeder script.
			-This is a rental npc script made to allow the renting of pecos falcons, carts, dragons (all 5 colors), mado gears, and gryphons.
			-All the coding in it uses the latest proper check and set functions, as well as the new BaseThird checks which allows for a small, clean, and optomized script. This should give a good example on how to use the BaseThird check.
		*Recoded the duel welding damage formula code.
			-Now cleaner and a little less coding.
		*Added SP_BASETHIRD.
			-This is used to check for the base of a 3rd job in general in NPC scripts.
		*Updated the pc_setfalcon, pc_setwug, and pc_wugrider functions.
			-They now do checks for falcons and wargs to prevent a player from having both when done through rental NPC's, unless the falcon_and_wug is set to allow it.
		*Updated the pc_setdragon function to now allow mounting players to different colored dragons through NPC scripts. Baby Rune Knights however will be mounted to a green on no matter what since they only have a green dragon sprite.
		*Corrected some possible glitch issues done by forced sitting.
		*MO_COMBOFINISH; CH_TIGERFIST; CH_CHAINCRUSH
			-Fixed a issue where the delays were smaller then they should be.
			-In official, the delay for each combo skill is 1 second and reduceable by AGI and DEX. (Bug is in eAthena)
			-Note: Need to find out if Sura combo skills are the same.
		*SR_TIGERCANNON
			-No longer ignores FLEE.
			-Fixed a issue where the added-on damage formula was incorrect.
			-Note: No proof has been shown that it ignores FLEE except from a early test when Sura's were recently added to kRO's sakray server. So a lot could of changed from then to now.
		*SR_RIDEINLIGHTNING
			-Fixed a issue where the casting was not interruptable.
		*Updated the script_commands file.
			-Info for the setdragon script command has been udpated for dragon color selection.

		*Added the latest tags and ID's to the enum tables for sprite display, skills, and status.
		*Fixed the stats increase/decrease calculations given by status's.
			-This was a mess and had to be redone after realizing the order of the calculations made a difference and were wrong. This is in response to the adding of the skill ALL_FULL_THROTTLE which could of increased the player's stats a lot more if this wasn't
			-fixed.
			-The rules of the calculations are as follow and as they should be....
				--1. Current stats are taken. Base + Bonus Stats (from job level bonus and equips)
				--1.5. If a status that reduces the stat down to 0 is active, the calculations ends.
				--2. Stats increases by a percentage are calculated.
				--3. Stats increases by a fixed amount are calculated.
				--4. Stats decreases by a percentage are calculated.
				--5. Stats decreases by a fixed amount are calculated.
				--6. Stats increase/decrease from the skill CG_MARIONETTE are calculated.
				--7. If rebirth soul link is active and a stat is below 50, it will be fixed to 50.
		*All Renewal Jobs
			-Updated the weight for all renewal introduced jobs to use their official values.
			--It doesn't matter if the game mechanics are classic or renewal. The weight limits would be the same. Its confirmed that the weight on all of the classic jobs are exactly the same on renewal as they were on classic. So the same rule would apply for
			--renewal jobs having the same weight in classic.
		*RK_DRAGONBREATH
			-Fixed a suspected issue where level 9 AoE size was incorrect.
				--This is due to the said AoE for RK_DRAGONBREATH_WATER on jRO's site.
			-Skill level 9's AoE is now 7x7.
		*GC_DARKCROW; RA_UNLIMIT; RK_DRAGONBREATH_WATER; ALL_FULL_THROTTLE
			-Added support for these skills.
			-Note: ALL_FULL_THROTTLE is not complete and only increases the player's stats.

			-Fixed a issue where the AoE wouldn't be removed when unmounting from a mado.
		*LG_OVERBRAND_BRANDISH
			-Fixed a issue where the caster's ASPD incorrectly affected the damage sequence. It will now affect it directly.
		*GN_HELLS_PLANT; GN_HELLS_PLANT_ATK
			-Updated the damage formula to the real official formula.
				--The 2011 balance document listed one part of the formula incorrectly.
				--The skill damage is no longer affected by your base level. It is now affected by the enemy's base level. This was tested on a official server.
		*RL_SLUGSHIT
			-Is now forced neutral.
				--The forced neutral part is unofficial, but due to its very high damage its best to set it like this until I can confirm if it takes weapon/ammo element.

				+Recoded the packet to work as it officially should.
					--The packet is supposed to divide all the character's on a account to be sent by 3 per packet and no higher. It turns out that sending all the characters in onepacket leads to issues, like noticeable delays when character select loads,
					--long delay when going from map to character select on character's saved in a high slot number, and in certain cases none of the character's will appear in character select if you have certain numbers of character's on a account.

			-Added support for these skills.
			-Not all of them are completely working since some of them only currently have the damage coded, but its enough to give players some new damage dealing skills. 2 for each mutated homunculus.
		*Added pre-support for mutated homunculus skills.
			-This support assigns the SC ID's and enables the SI's needed for them, as well as add the needed stuff to the status file.
		*RK_DRAGONBREATH
			-Recoded the entire skill.
			-It was found that the skill deals weapon type damage even tho your ATK doesen't affect the damage at all. Its basicly like how Mechanic's Self Destruction works.

		*GN_CRAZYWEED; GN_CRAZYWEED_ATK

	r283 [15peaces]
		*Merged missing changes from 3ceam rev. 728 - 729
		*Fixed an issue where the Banding status crashed the map server.
		*Fixed vendinglist packet structures & lenghts.
		*Added a hand full of missing status tags & skill placeholders from the EP14.3 Part 2 Update.

03/20/2021
	r282 [15peaces]
		*Merged missing changes from 3ceam rev. 725 - 727
		*Some updates to item database.
			-Added some missing item set bonuses.
			-Made Tare_Pope_ refinable.
		*Fixed an issue where the skill_castfix function crashes the map server.
		*Fixed a issue where the server would go into a infinite loop when a regular or evolved homunculus would reach level 99 with more then enough exp needed.
		*This update completes the main support for the mutated homunculus and is now ready for public testing. Their's a few things to know when testing....
			-1. A homunculus can only be mutated when its level 99 and in its evolved form.
			-2. Mutation's function requires a ID value to know which form to mutate the homunculus into.
			-3. When making your NPC script, be sure to have it check if the player is a Genetic. Official server's requries the player to be one. The mutation function will not check the player's job.
			-4. The homunculus will remember the skills from its previous form when its mutated, but only the ones that were unlocked (opened for leveling up) or leveled. Any skills that arnt unlocked before mutation will no longer be learnable. The same goes for 
				the evolved loyalty skill.
			-Be sure to warn players about this in the NPC script to avoid complaints and confusion.
			-5. All of the mutation skills except Poison Mist currently doesn't work. Their usable, but will not do anything. These skills will be coded soon in the near future.
			-6. The system was tested up and down to make sure its stable, bug free, and safe to use, however I can't promise its entirely bug free. GM's can safely mess with them through commands and test NPC scripts. Its your choice if you want to allow them to 
				be accessible to your players.
		*Updated the makehomun command.
			-Typing a unsupported ID or not typing any ID will make a list of homunculus and their ID's display on the chat window. Its very similar to how the list in the jobchange command is. Currently lists regular, evolved, and mutated homunculus.
		*Added the hommutation command.
			-This command allows you to mutate your homunculus and choose what form to mutate into.

				--DO NOT MAKE THEM ACCESSABLE TO PLAYERS!!!! Stat growth settings and mutation procedures still need to be coded and if allowed to be player accessible their homunculus's growth will be below what it should be.
			-Added needed parts of the system to allow them to be stable and playable for testing purposes.
				--Entry's for them were added to the homunculus database.

		*Merged missing changes from 3ceam rev. 708 - 710
		*Some random cleaning in npc/custom/ folder.
		*Added pre-support to a number of Kagerou/Oboro skills.
			-This support makes casting, skill, and status animations work and sets the base needed for these kinds of skills. This doesen't mean the skills do their effects yet.
		*Added support for the attribute spheres system.
			-This system is a copy of the regular sphere system, but uses different declarations, a different packet, and some special checks to set what spirit type to show on screen.
			-The system was copied to be dedicated to itself to avoid any possible conflicts due to the additional features.
		*KO_HAPPOKUNAI / Spray Kunai
			-Damage formula changed to a fixed damage formula.
			-The previous formula is for sure not official because using explosive kunai or flying fish gives 5000% ATK at max skill level. A AoE Gate of Hell like damage skill is just overpowered.

10/18/2020
	r272 [15peaces]
		*Merged missing changes from 3ceam rev. 704 - 707
		*Added support for the feature.auction config.
			-The auction system became unstable on clients 2012 onwards (exact date not known).
			-It has been fixed on clients 2013-05-15 onwards.
			-It was removed on clients 2014-11-12 and later.
			-The server will also auto-disable it on unsupported clients.
		*Fixed an issue where the MVP EXP reward message was not shown correctly on clients 20131223 and newer.
			-The ZC_MVP_GETTING_SPECIAL_EXP packet was removed on these clients so it is disabled now.
			-Added mvp_exp_reward_message config to allow re-enabling this message in an custom way.
			-Thanks to rAthena.
		*Removed the renewal_edp setting from the skill battle file.
			-A lot was learned about EDP's effect on Assassin and Guillotine Cross since the day the setting was added in the past and with all that has changed with EDP and the adding of another EDP update in this revision, the setting has become obsolete.
		*Added the EDP formula config settings for Guillotine Cross skills to the skill battle file.
			-The formula is set through 3 values which allows flexable adjustments for balancing.
			-The damage boost through these settings only affect all Guillotine Cross skills and the damage is increased in a renewal EDP way. This doesn't affect assassin skills in any way.
			-Guillotine Cross skills that have their damage boosted by EDP should be handled in a renewal way.
		*Did a small cleanup.
		*Recoded the entire multi-hit system code used for regular attacking.
			-The old system was limited and had a bug with Chain Action and Fear Breeze that couldn't be resolved. The new code replaces the old code with a cleaner, more efficient code that minimizes required CPU usage. This brings the behavior to official and
			-follows a set of rules.
				--1. If a required condition for double attacking is met, a success chance value is generated depending on the conditions that affect the success chance.
				--2. If more then 1 of the main conditions is met, a success chance value will be generated at the end of each of those conditions. The highest success chance value will then be taken and used for double attacking. The values will not stack.
				--3. If the player has Fear Breeze status active, it will take priority over a percentage of the double attack's success change. The percentage depends on the level of Fear Breeze.
				--4. When Fear Breeze has the priority, itl check if its success chance is triggered. If so, then itl deal a number of hits depending on the skill level used and the success chance.
				--5. If Fear Breeze's success chance is missed and the player has a double attacking success chance higher then Fear Breeze's success chance, the remaining double attacking success chance will attempt to trigger.
				--6. Fear Breeze and Double Attack will not trigger on the same attack. If Fear Breeze success chance is triggered, then the chance of double attacking through the double attack code will be ignored.
			-Example: A Ranger has Fear Breeze level 5 active with a bow equipt and also has Shadow Warrior status level 5. This means his Fear Breeze has a 30% chance of triggering and Shadow Warrior's Double Attack would normally be 50% chance, but Fear Breeze
			-will overlap the first 30% of the Double Attack success chance. If the success trigger number generated on a single attack is between 1 to 30 percent, Fear Breeze will trigger. If the success trigger generated is outside that range, but between 31 to
			-50 percent, double attack will trigger. If the success trigger is between 51 to 100, the chance of dealing a multi-hitting attack will fail.	
		*Added and updated some items.
			-Corrected the weight on Light of El Dicastes and Guardian's Pendant.
			-Added complete support for the 5 Eclage items that give or use skills.
			-Added the Promise Bible's Vol's 1 and 2. DEF is balanced out for pre-renewal as usual.

			-Ahura Mazdah now gives access to the Eclage status cures skills on the skill window.
		*Added a enum table in for the Eclage status cure items.

			-This is in case of any future changes that require adding cooldowns to them.
		*Eclage status cure items are coded to have a reuse delay equal to the cooldown of the skill each one of them casts.
		*Added support for the ZC_SPIRITS_ATTRIBUTE packet.
			-This isnt being used yet, but will be needed later for Kagerou/Oboro talisman spheres.

		*RA_CAMOUFLAGE

			-Also fixed STR-Bonus of King Dramoh Card.
			-Added full support for Birthday IdRO10th Scroll.
		*Fixed a linker warning if compiled with VS 2012.
		*Changed 'tick' variables to 64 bit
			-This fixes an issue with timers that stop working after about 24-49 days when the tick overflows (note that this may happen much earlier than that, and at hard to predict times, on some systems)
			-Updated the RDTSC help message in the configure script to also warn users about issues with SpeedStep enabled systems.
			-On Windows, tick() still has a resolution of 10~15ms (or even as low as 100ms on some systems).
			-Note: on Windows versions earlier than 6.x (Vista, Server 2008), the tick overflow issue is NOT fixed, since they don't support the function used to retrieve a 64 bit tick. This isn't a big issue, since
				those platforms are already - or going soon to be - out of their extended support period, and it's already advisable to upgrade, for other reasons. If you're the unfortunate user of such a system, it is
				recommended that you reboot your machine at least once every 49 days for 15-3athena to work reliably.
			-Note: To clear some doubts, this has absolutely NOTHING to do with 32/64 bit CPUs or OSes. It's all about a variable's size, not the size of registers of your CPU, and a 32bit CPU will be able to handle this just 
				fine.
			-Thanks to @HerculesWS.
		*Fixed & updated item_package system.
			-Random items will now drop randomly.
			-all items are identified.
			-added a new flag: isAnnounced.
				--Setting this to 1, will broadcast this item if dropped.

			-animation appearing on every cell, which is 15 cells every 0.150 seconds. Enough to flood all your sound channels and hurt your hears. So the temp code will continue to be used until the animation is replaced.
		*Added UNIT ID for MH_VOLCANIC_ASH.

		*Fixed WM_SATURDAY_NIGHT_FEVER to be more official. Still a bit buggy, but it works much better.
		*Changed GN_HELLS_PLANT_ATK damage formula to a more thought out and balanced one.
			-The old one clearly showed it was over powered due to players being able to deal over 14k damage on other players if the caster had 120 INT, max level AM_CANNIBALIZE and GN_HELLS_PLANT, and the target was level 150. Even with renewal mechanics the 
				--damage would be the same. That damage can kill most players easly in PVP, which is bullshit. So that old formula was proven to be incorrect and needed a temporarly change until we can get the official one.
				--Note: Hell Plant may be stable and slightly buggy, but is now in question if it needs to be recoded.

			-this function was updated for the new ragexe, but there was a typo until today.
			-sorry for this.
		*Reduced the timer interval from 50ms to 20ms (official value)
			-For a long time it is well known that the Aegis interval is 20ms, but devs have been hesitant to set it to that out of performance reasons; these days however, machines are better and there aren't really many 2000+ player servers anymore, so a 20ms interval is actually quite viable now.
			-Setting the interval to 20ms makes the server perfectly in sync with the client that expects the server to have a delay of no longer than 20ms.
			-All skills that are "chain-able" on official servers will now also be 100% chain-able here (previously it just worked to 40%), assuming there is no lag
			-Skills with cast time will no longer go off 30ms later than officially
			-Several others improvements in regards of client-server sync (timers are used almost everywhere)
			-This might increase the CPU usage by up to ~50%, if you have trouble running your server with this, you can increase it again in timer.c (TIMER_MIN_INTERVAL)
			-Bosses are now able to ignore skill-induced walk delay. They can for example walk after casting Sonic Blow.
		*RA_AIMEDBOLT; RA_WUGSTRIKE; RA_WUGBITE; RA_WUGRIDER; SC_SHADOWFORM
			-Added full support for these skills. However some formulas may be outdated. ^^
